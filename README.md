# ♻️ Recycling & Organic Waste Recovery — Yearly Summary

### 📘 Project Overview

This Python project analyzes multi-year **municipal solid waste datasets** (e.g. _Boralesgamuwa: 2012–2018_).  
It automatically cleans, standardizes, and simulates **waste recovery performance** to estimate recovery efficiency and recycling potential.  
The system produces year-wise and total summaries, along with human-readable insights.

## 🧭 Workflow

**Flow:**

Each step is fully automated and modular — the program can handle any CSV with date, waste type, and weight columns.

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Automatic column detection (handles multiple CSV formats)  
✅ Waste type standardization (dictionary + regex mapping)  
✅ Simulation of recovery rates for each material  
✅ Year-wise and total summaries  
✅ Automated insight generation (top recovery material, composting notes, etc.)  
✅ Timestamped CSV output saving

## 🧮 Recovery Rate Reference

| Material Type | Recovery Rate |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Plastics      | 0.55          |
| Metals        | 0.78          |
| Glass         | 0.65          |
| E-waste       | 0.72          |
| Organic       | 0.25          |
| MSW           | 0.10          |

## 📂 Input Dataset

**File:** `boralasgamuwa_2012-2018.csv`

The dataset should include at least these columns (names can vary):

| Column      | Example Values            |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Date        | 2016-03-21                |
| Waste Type  | plastic, food waste, iron |
| Weight (kg) | 125.5                     |

> Don’t worry if column names are different — the code auto-detects them (e.g. `collection_date`, `ticket_date`, `Weight(kg)` etc.)

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Cleaning

Removes invalid data, renames columns, and formats text consistently.

### 2️⃣ Standardization

Maps waste type names to standardized material names (Plastics, Metals, Organic, etc.)  
and assigns recovery rates automatically.

### 3️⃣ Simulation

Calculates recovered material using:

### 4️⃣ Summarization

Creates two summary tables:

- **by_mat** → Total recovery by material
- **by_year** → Year-wise recovery summary

### 5️⃣ Interpretation

Generates automatic insights:

### 6️⃣ Output Saving

All results are stored in `/outputs/` with unique timestamps.

=== Total Recovery Summary by Material ===
 Material   Collected_kg   Recovered_kg   Efficiency(%)
 Plastics   6287094.0      3457901.7      55.00
 Metals     334260.0       260722.8       78.00
 Glass      12000.0        7800.0         65.00
 Organic    334260.0       83565.0        25.00
 MSW        6287094.0      628709.4       10.00

6) Interpretation:
• Highest recovery efficiency: Metals (78%)
• Largest recovered mass: Plastics (3,457,901.7 kg)
• Organic waste recovery (25%) reflects composting potential and collection efficiency.
